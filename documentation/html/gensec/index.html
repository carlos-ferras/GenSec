		<p>			
			It is an user friendly application which simplifies the 
			generation of measurement sequences for automated 
			luminescence reader LF02 in an XML file.
			During measurement the LF02 adds the measurement
			data to the same file, therefore measuring parameters 
			and data are saved together.
		</p>	
		<p>
			In addition to the possibility of defining the parameters of basic
			measuring processes (OSL, LM-OSL, POSL, TL, Illumination and Preheating), 
			the GenSec allows the "merging" of  these commands, which significantly
			reduces the measuring time.
