		<p>
			The automated luminescence reader LF02 has been designed to carry out complex sequences of beta irradiation and luminescence measurement on a 
			considerable number of samples without exposing them to light. The conditions in which these sequences are performed, are determined by a significant number
			of parameters. 
		</p>	
		<p>
			Sequence-Toolkit (STK) is used in the generation and posterior analysis of the measurement sequences. 
			The STK was programmed on the basis of technical task elaborated by the LF02 developers. 
		</p>	
		<p>	
			For the accomplishment of these tasks the
			STK has a set of applications (GenSec, GenRep, GenVis) and a help assistant .
